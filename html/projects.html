                    <p>This project was done as a part of <strong>Office Depot 2019 Internship Case Competition</strong> in a team of 6 people, one of which was working remotely with the rest of us.</p>
                    <p>In the team I was fulfilling the roles of the <strong>Tech Lead</strong>, as well as <strong>Designer</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The goal of the project was to create a working executive dashboard prototype, which would display usefull information in the form of graphs, gauges, KPIs, etc. The data would come from a variety of sources, but mainly from Salesforce.
                        It would then be parsed and displayed to the screen via a web dashboard application <strong><a href="https://www.qlik.com/us/">Qlik</a></strong>. </p>
                    <p>The great thing about the whole dashboard is that it also works on all mobile devices.</p>
